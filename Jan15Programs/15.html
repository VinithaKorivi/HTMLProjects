Here are some tips to improve your performance in an interview:

1. Prepare an introduction
An introduction may be the first thing an interviewer asks. It is a great opportunity for them to evaluate you and for you to highlight your skills. Prepare an introduction beforehand and practise it. Keep it short, for instance, anywhere between 30 seconds and two minutes. Give a brief overview of your skills, experience and how you may be a good fit for the job.

 regarding their education, specialisations and work experience. This may enable you to interact with them confidently.

3. Practise your answers
Try practising your answers to common questions beforehand. You can practise them in front of a mirror or take a video so that you are aware of your tone, body language and facial mannerisms. Practising can help you deliver your answers in a clear way and sound confidennt

4. Arrive early
Punctuality is a virtue that interviewers appreciate in candidates. Determine how much time it may take for you to reach the place and plan to leave early. Reach at least 15 minutes early so that you can settle down and be comfortable before the interview starts.

5. Dress appropriately
Make sure you have appropriate attire for an interview. Even if a company has a casual dress code, you may have to dress professionally for an interview. Ensure that your clothes are fresh and ironed.

6. Bring all necessary documents
Make sure that you bring all the necessary documents for an interview. Take copies of your resume and other relevant documents if necessary. If you are unsure of what documents to bring, you can ask the interviewer for this information in your interview confirmation email.

7. Ask questions at the end of an interview
Usually, the interviewer may ask you if you have any questions for them. Be ready with some relevant questions regarding the job, the work culture or any other area you may have queries in. This can leave a positive impression on the interviewer as it demonstrates your enthusiasm and willingness to learn.

What are the steps in an interviewing process?
Though different companies can conduct an interviewing process differently depending on their needs, protocols and the industry, here are some of the steps you may encounter during an interview:

Screening interview
In a screening interview, a recruiter tries to determine whether a candidate is suitable for a job and if they should proceed to the next stage. Sometimes, employers replace this step with an open interview. Companies typically conduct open interviews at an open hiring event, where they interview multiple candidates at the same time. It usually involves a brief discussion and straightforward questions to gauge a candidate's suitability for a job.

Phone interview
Sometimes companies may start the process with a phone interview. They usually use this to narrow down the pool of candidates and select interested candidates for a job. An in-person interview may usually follow, though interviewers hiring for remote positions often have to rely solely on video or phone interviews to recruit ideal candidates. An interviewer may schedule a phone interview in advance via email or phone.

Skill assessment
Some positions can require candidates to take a skill assessment test, which may evaluate a candidate's aptitude for a particular job. For example, an employer might ask a candidate applying for a writing position to take a grammar test or write a test piece. With this, the company determines whether a candidate has the necessary skills to perform their jobs successfully. Companies also use a skill assessment test to evaluate existing employees for promotions.

First interview
Also known as a pre-interview, the first usually begins with a one-on-one interview with a hiring manager. The interviewer typically asks questions about the candidate's qualifications, skills, work history and relevant experience. They also try to determine if a candidate would be a good fit for the company culture. The company may shortlist some candidates after this interview who can proceed to the next round of the interview.

Second interview
After an initial in-person interview, a second interview is usually more in depth and may even be a technical interview. A second interview is to determine whether candidates are genuine contenders for the job and further reduce the pool of candidates. Sometimes it may be additional meetings with the same interviewer, or it can be a day-long meeting with various members of the staff, like executives and supervisors.

Lunch or dinner interview
Depending on the type of role you are applying for, your interviewer may ask you to join them for lunch or dinner. They may share information regarding the job role and ask you relevant questions about your background. This helps them evaluate your etiquette, interpersonal skills and communication skills in a more relaxed setting.

Background check
At some point during the interview, the employer or an HR executive may conduct a background check to verify the information you have shared with them. Depending on the results, your application can progress through the interview or be withdrawn from consideration. Hence, always ensure that you provide the right information to an interviewer.

Job offer
If you successfully progress through the interviewing process, the last phase is when the employer makes you a job offer. You are provided information regarding the terms and conditions, compensation and benefits of the position. Make sure that you study the offer letter carefully before accepting it. If you would like to adjust a certain aspect of it, you can make a counter-offer. After negotiations are over, you may either accept or decline the job offer.</p>
