            <h1>ROSE</h1>
            <p>10 Lines on Rose Flower: A rose is 
                a woody annual flowering plant with over
                 three hundred species and ten thousands of 
                 cultivars. These flowers vary in size and form 
                 and are usually large and flashy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. 
                 They also have a delightful 
                fragrance, which varies according 
                to the variety and climate conditions.
                 Most rose species are native to Asia, 
                smaller numbers being
                native to America and a few to Europe and North-West Africa.
                 The plants are mainly erect, and the stems are usually copiously armed 
                 with prickles of various shapes and sizes, called thorns. Roses, in today’s world, 
                 have acquired cultural importance in many societies.</p>
