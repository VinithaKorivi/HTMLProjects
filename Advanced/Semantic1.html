            <li class="a"> Lakshmi Narasimha is an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, combining Narasimha (lion-man) with Goddess
                Lakshmi,
                symbolizing power with compassion.</li>


            <li>He appeared to protect his devotee Prahlada and to destroy the demon king Hiranyakashipu, who was
                granted
                special boons.</li>

            <li> Narasimha is half-man and half-lion, showing that God transcends normal forms and rules.</li>
            Goddess Lakshmi sits on His lap, calming His fierce nature and representing grace, prosperity, and peace.

            <li> He killed Hiranyakashipu at twilight, on the threshold, using His nails, perfectly bypassing the
                demon’s
                boons.</li>

            <li>Lakshmi Narasimha represents the balance of ugra (fierce) and saumya (gentle) forms of divinity.</li>
            <li> Devotees believe worshipping Him removes fear, negativity, and evil forces.</li>

            <li>He is especially worshipped for protection, courage, and relief from obstacles.</li>
            <li>Famous temples include Ahobilam (Andhra Pradesh) and Yadadri (Telangana).</li>

            <li> Chanting the Lakshmi Narasimha mantra is believed to bring peace, prosperity, and spiritual strength.
