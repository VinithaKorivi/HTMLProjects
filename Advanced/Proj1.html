	<p>By studying the other planets in our own Solar System, we can try to place Earth in context. ESA has already sent spacecraft to Earth’s nearest planetary neighbours – Mars and Venus – to understand why they evolved so differently, and in the next decade we’ll be unlocking the secrets of the innermost planet, Mercury, too. The gas giants, and in particular Jupiter with its four large moons – some of which may harbour underground oceans – is also key to piece together the Solar System evolution. Unravelling the behaviour of our parent star, the Sun, is another crucial element to decipher our cosmic origins. And as more and more planets are found orbiting other stars, understanding our own cosmic neighbourhood has never been so important.

What about the origin of the Universe itself? If we could ‘see’ microwaves, the night sky would glow with the very first light ever released into space. This is the relic radiation of the Big Bang – the event that set the beginning to the Universe itself. </p>
